# Development plans

This is the entry point for selecting the current execution plan. Read
[AGENTS.md](../../AGENTS.md), the [architecture decisions](00_architecture_and_decisions.md),
the [specification](01_specification.md) and [val.md](../../val.md) before
implementing a task. A plan does not supersede frozen decisions or approve a
pending policy/schema amendment.

## Current execution package

The current plan is the **2026-10-03 reliability execution package v1.2**,
revised after code review at `781366e` at the maintainer's request. It adds
run-persistence redaction, shared file-read boundaries, input-capture phases and
an explicit dependency-specification prerequisite. Start at the
[package index](reliability-2026-10-03/README.md), then read the
[execution guide](reliability-2026-10-03/00_Execution_Guide.md) and the assigned
Sprint/Session document. The first implementation session is **S1-A: R00 and R01**.

- [Copyable agent prompts](reliability-2026-10-03/AGENT_PROMPTS.md)
- [Task dependencies and gates](reliability-2026-10-03/00_Execution_Guide.md)
- [Sprint 1: persistence and effective state](reliability-2026-10-03/01_Persistence_and_State.md)
- [Sprint 2: dependency accuracy](reliability-2026-10-03/02_Dependency_Accuracy.md)
- [Sprint 3: scanning and runtime evidence](reliability-2026-10-03/03_Scan_and_Runtime_Evidence.md)
- [Sprint 4: recipe and release](reliability-2026-10-03/04_Recipe_and_Release.md)
- [Policy and compatibility decisions](reliability-2026-10-03/05_Policy_and_Compatibility.md)
- [Validation, adoption and application evidence](reliability-2026-10-03/06_Validation_and_Adoption.md)

The package contains planned work. Importing it does not mark R00–R08, D01–D03
or A01–A03 implemented, change the judge drift policy in Issue #9, or complete
the pending resource gates. Resume from the assigned session and its actual
predecessor report, checking the current HEAD rather than resetting to the
reviewed commit.

## Previous plans and delivery status

The existing M1–M12 and UX plans remain historical task/acceptance records:

- [UX3: run readiness and navigation](UX3_2026-10-02.md), including its pending
  [judge policy proposal](https://github.com/EnumaElish123/ReproLLM/issues/9).
- [UX2: experiment workflow improvements](UX2_2026-10-02.md).
- [Earlier UX repairs](UX_2026-10-02.md) and
  [proposal status](ux-2026-10-02-proposals/README.md).
- [Adoption plans M9–M12](M9-M12_adoption.md) and [backlog](backlog.md).
- [Current release and delivery status](../community/roadmap.md), which remains
  the public availability index alongside [CHANGELOG.md](../../CHANGELOG.md).

Do not infer current feature availability or approval from historical sprint
dates alone.
