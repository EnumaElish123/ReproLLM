## [Unreleased]

## [0.0.1] - 2026-09-13

### Added

- Project skeleton, quality tooling (ruff, mypy `--strict`, pytest), CI matrix
  (Linux/macOS/Windows), and trusted-publishing release workflow.
- Pydantic v2 schemas for every persisted document (manifest, lock, run record,
  profile, project rules, config, finding, audit report) with exported JSON
  Schemas and a `reprollm schema export` command.
- Deterministic audit engine (Level 0) with a rule registry, the implicit
  `core` profile, and the first two rules: `code.git_repo`, `code.git_commit`.
- `reprollm audit` (text/JSON output, exit codes per threshold) and
  `reprollm doctor` (environment diagnostics, opt-in network probe).
- Golden fixture repository infrastructure with deterministic commit SHAs and
  snapshot testing.

Not yet usable: `init`, `lock`, `run`, `diff`, `export`, and the full rule
catalog arrive in 0.1.0+ (see `docs/plan/00_architecture_and_decisions.md`).
